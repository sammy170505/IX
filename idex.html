                        I am currently pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Binghamton University. I am part of SWE 
                        program of iX.

                        In my role as a Software Team Member on Binghamton Universityâ€™s Mars Rover Competition team, I have played a pivotal role in creating the control systems of our prototype. Collaborating closely with a multidisciplinary team, I successfully integrated data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and GPS devices, enabling real-time decision-making and autonomous operation. 
                        I designed and implemented a communication program between the rover and the base station utilizing Dart, C, and Python programming languages, coupled with Raspberry Pi. This experience ensured efficient data exchange and troubleshooting capabilities, showcasing my expertise in software development and system integration.

                        Additionally, as a researcher in the First-Year Research Immersion Program at Binghamton University, I collaborated with a team of seven students to develop an automatic strike zone detection system for baseball. By integrating OpenPose, a Python library, and YOLO, a deep learning algorithm, we achieved precise real-time object recognition, enabling us to track players' movements and positions on the field with 89% accuracy. We used PyTorch, a machine learning framework, specifically in training and optimizing the model that supported our object recognition and pose estimation program design. We used NumPy, a Python library to preprocess and manipulate data which improved the quality of our system in handling various data transformations and calculations.
